# Design

This is a DSM inbox where users can see conversations on the left side. The user can then click on one to open up the contents of the conversation and view the chat messages.

## Inbox

On the very left, there is a small nav bar.

In the middle left, there are two lists of conversations: read and unread.

- user info
  - username
  - time that user has been online
- list of rooms available

On the right, there is a selected conversation.

- conversation information
  - who the user is talking to
- messages
  - message text
  - username of the user that posted it

## Notes

- In the chat message box, whenever a new message comes in, it should scroll to the bottom.
- In the chat message box, the newest messages should be on the bottom, older on the top. The user can scroll up to see older messages.
- The list of conversations should be a fixed width, and the chat message box should fill.
- Stretch Goal: If multiple browser tabs are open, all browser tabs should show the new chat messages.
